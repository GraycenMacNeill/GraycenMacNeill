## Hello, my name is Graycen MacNeill.

I have a deep passion for computers and software development, with a particular focus on game development. Over the years, I’ve built a strong foundation in programming logic and the complexities of the development process, which I’ve applied through creating video games using Unreal Engine. My work reflects both my technical expertise and creative vision.

In addition to game development, I actively share my knowledge with others. I run a YouTube channel where I produce high-quality tutorials on Unreal Engine and programming,  aimed at helping others fully understand these areas and achieve their own success.

### ♜ Additional Areas of Focus:
- Video Editing and Post-Production
- 2D & 3D Graphic Design
- Business Strategy, Management, and Marketing
